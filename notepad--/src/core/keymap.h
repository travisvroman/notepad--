/**
 * @file keymap.h
 * @author Travis Vroman (travis@kohiengine.com)
 * @brief This file contains the structures and functions required to
 * implement keymaps and keybindings, used to translate keyboard input
 * events to events and/or call bound functions automatically. Keymaps 
 * replace the need for checks of key states in that they will instead
 * invoke callback functions instead.
 * Maps will be added onto a stack, where bindings are
 * replaced along the way. For example, if the base keymap
 * defines the "escape" key as an application quit, then
 * another keymap added on re-defines the key to nothing while
 * adding a new binding for "a", then "a"'s binding will work,
 * and "escape" will do nothing. If "escape" were left undefined
 * in the second keymap, the original mapping is left unchanged.
 * Maps are pushed/popped as expected on a stack.
